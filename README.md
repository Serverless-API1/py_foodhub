# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Menu Order System

This is a simple menu order system presented to the user. On the system (or app), the user is presented with a menu and is allowed to choose items on the menu. The menu includes prices.

*I am assumming that you already have python installed in your system or computer. So I won't cover the steps involved in installing python hereon.*

## üìã Project Overview

This interactive command-line (CLI) application allows customers to:
- View a restaurant menu with South African Rand (ZAR) pricing
- Select multiple items with specified quantities
- View an itemized order summary with total cost
- Visualize their order with charts and graphs
- Save their order receipt to a text file
